Attendance App (MERN, MVC)

Features
- Teacher auth: signup/login with JWT sessions
- Create class: name, students (manual, join link placeholder, spreadsheet import placeholder)
- Class list: shows join code and active state
- Activate class: 4-minute session generates QR (frontend placeholder) and auto-deactivates on expiry
- Attendance: students mark by session link; records stored per day
- PDF downloads: placeholder page, ready to implement server-side PDF generation
- Responsive, modern UI with custom brand colors; animated teacher on landing and classes page

How to use
1) Sign up/login as a teacher (Auth page)
2) Go to Classes to create a class and manage sessions
3) Activate a class to start a 4-minute attendance window; students scan/join to mark themselves
4) View class list and export attendance later (download page placeholder)

Environment
- Set MONGO_URI with your MongoDB connection string
- Set JWT_SECRET for signing tokens

Where to set
- Preferred: use the Dev Server environment variables (Settings) or deployment provider dashboard
- Alternatively, add a .env with MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET (not recommended to commit)
